## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18.x or above
- MySQL v8.x or above
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Backend Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sfaizal88/my-cafe-backend.git
   cd my-cafe-backend
   ```

2. **Setup the Database:**

   - Navigate to the `database` folder and run the `db.sql` file in your MySQL database to create the required tables and database.

   - Update your MySQL database credentials in `src/config/dbConfig.js`. You can refer to the `.env` file for the original hostname, username, and password.

3. **Install Backend Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Backend Server:**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   - Note the port on which the server is running.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the Frontend Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sfaizal88/my-cafe-frontend.git
   cd my-cafe-frontend
   ```

2. **Update API URL:**

   - In the `src/api/constants.ts` file, update the API URL with the backend server's port.

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Frontend Application:**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   - The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
